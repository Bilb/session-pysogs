; SOGS configuration.  Copy this file to sogs.ini and edit as desired.  It can be left mostly (or
; entirely) empty: defaults are shown in the comments.

[db]

; The database connection string url for the sogs database where everything is stored.  For sqlite
; (currently the only supported database) this is `sqlite:///` followed by the path.  E.g.
; `sqlite:///sogs.db` for sogs.db in the current working directory, or `sqlite:////path/to/sogs.db`
; for an absolute URL.
;url = sqlite:///sogs.db


[crypto]

; Path to the x25519 private key file; this is a 32-byte file containing the raw private key data.
;
;key_file = key_x25519


[net]

; Base url for generating self-referring links, for example for the open group URL and QR code shown
; when accessing via a web browser.  Can be http, https, and may or may not include a port.  This
; should be the address of a front-end proxy server (e.g. nginx or apache2) that forwards uwsgi
; requests to pysogs.  Using HTTPS is possible but not particularly recommended: onion requests are
; already encrypted and so the extra layer of HTTPS encryption does not make requests more secure.
;
;base_url = http://example.net


; Listening address for oxenmq requests. The socket uses curve encryption using the same x25519 key
; as the server itself.  Can be specified as a multiline value to listen on multiple
; addresses/ports.

; Internal listening address (usually a unix socket path starting with ipc://) for inter-process
; communication between sogs processes.  This is unauthenticated and so must not be a publicly
; accessible address!
;
;omq_internal = ipc://./omq.sock


; Whether we should show recent messages for public rooms on the sogs room page when visited by a
; browser.
;
;http_show_recent = yes


[files]

; How long newly uploaded files should be stored before being cleaned up, in days.  Note that
; changing this only affects new files.  This limit does not apply to room images and attachments in
; pinned messages, both of which do not expire.
;
;expiry = 15


; The maximum size of files we accept, in bytes.  Note that onion requests impose a maximum size of
; messages, and so this should not be larger than 6MB, but can be reduced to not accept larger files
; in open groups.  Value is in bytes.
;
;max_size = 6000000


[rooms]

; How many days we consider a user to be "active" in a room without having at least retrieved
; messages from the room, in days.  (This must be â‰¤ active_prune_threshold, below).

; How long we store user-room activity information, so that we can determine "active within the past
; x days" values other than the default.

[messages]

; How long we keep message edit/deletion history, in days.
;
;history_prune_threshold = 30


; Path to a file containing "bad" words for message filtration.  This feature in temporary and will
; be removed once more robust bot/spam filtering is available.  The default is to use the file
; `badwords.txt` if it exists, and nothing if it doesn't.  If specified explicitly then the file

; The log level controlling which messages should be displayed.  One of: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING,
